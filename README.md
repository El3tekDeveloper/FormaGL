# FormaGL
FromaGL is a lightweight C++ framework built on top of modern OpenGL. It provides ready-to-use tools for rendering, lighting, geometry, model loading, optimization, and basic physics — designed to simplify graphics programming and game development without the overhead of a full engine. Work in progress.
